Create a RESTful service that  will be used to maintain a list of courses along with their unique id. You should be able to add, remove, list, show courses.
Implement in the RESTful style. For example.

If you type the URL
http://localhost:8080/<context>/course/add/Ruby

Ruby course gets added to the list with a unique id and you get a message "Ruby successfully added"

If you type the URL
http://localhost:8080/<context>/course/show/1
The output is "Ruby"

If you type the URL
http://localhost:8080/<context>/course/add/Grails

Grails course gets added to the list with a unique id and you get a message "Grails successfully added"

If you type the URL
http://localhost:8080/<context>/course/list
The output is
1-->Ruby
2-->Grails

The output of all the methods will be in JSON format.
